# vex-snippets
all sorts of vex code bits and pieces

The python script scrapes all of the snippets I host on my website fxnotes.xyz and formats them correctly to be used with the [Vex Snippet Library](https://github.com/jakobringler/Vex_Snippet_Library)

You just have to copy the json folder to the Vex Snippet Library folder once you installed it.
